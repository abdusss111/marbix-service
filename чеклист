## Required Changes

### 1. Add Exit/Logout Button for Mobile
**Issue:** In mobile version exit button is very low, can not click it
**Solution:** 
- Move a logout/exit button higher in the mobile burger menu
- Use appropriate icon (logout icon, X, or "Выйти" text)
- Ensure it's easily tappable

### 2. Remove "Create Another Strategy" Text
**Issue:** Unnecessary prompt asking users to create another strategy
**Solution:**
- Remove the text "Хотите создать еще одну стратегию?" completely
- Remove any associated buttons or UI elements
- Clean up the layout after removal

### 3. Restore Progress/Stages Indicator
**Issue:** Missing progress indicators showing current and **upcoming stages**
**Solution:**
- Add back the stages/steps indicator showing:
  - What stages are being processed
  - Current stage being worked on
  - What stages are coming next

### 4. Reorganize Layout Priority in strategies/strategyId page
**Current layout needs restructuring:**

**New Layout Order (top to bottom):**


1. **"Полная стратегия" block should be at the beginning of blocks list
   - Make this the primary focus
   - Expand text content to use full screen width
   - Ensure proper text formatting and readability
4. **AI Chat Block - BELOW strategy content**
   - Move AI chat component underneath the strategy text, their width should be similar
   - Maintain full functionality but secondary position

### 5. Fix Mobile Text Formatting in full strategy 
**Issue:** Poor text wrapping and formatting on mobile
**Solution:**
- Implement proper text wrapping for long content
- Ensure adequate line height for readability (1.4-1.6)
- Use appropriate font sizes for mobile (minimum 16px)
- Add proper margins and padding for comfortable reading
- Handle long words/URLs with word-break: break-word
- Ensure proper spacing between paragraphs and sections


### Mobile Text Optimization
- **Paragraphs:** Clear spacing between sections
- **Headings:** Proper hierarchy (H2, H3, etc.)
- **Lists:** Well-formatted bullet points and numbered lists
- **Line breaks:** Appropriate spacing for readability
- **Code/Technical text:** Horizontal scrolling if needed, or proper wrapping

## Responsive Breakpoints
Ensure these changes work across device sizes:
- **Mobile:** < 768px (primary focus)
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1024px 
- **Desktop:** > 1024px (maintain existing functionality)

## User Experience Goals
1. **Clear navigation:** Easy exit from mobile
2. **Progress awareness:** Users know where they are in the process
3. **Content focus:** Strategy content is the primary element
4. **Accessibility:** Proper touch targets and readable text
5. **Professional appearance:** Clean, organized layout

## Testing Considerations
After implementation, verify:
- Exit button works on all mobile devices
- Text wraps properly without horizontal scrolling
- Progress indicator accurately reflects current state
- AI chat remains functional in new position
- All touch targets are appropriately sized
- Content is readable without zooming

Update the existing component with these improvements while maintaining all current functionality.
